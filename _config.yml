title: "Human Resources Data Visualization Dashboard"
description: >-
  As product manager, I was asked to turn fragmented HR reporting into a single,
  governed product. I started with stakeholder interviews across HR Ops, TA,
  Compensation, DEI, Finance, and Execs to map needs and points of friction.
  We aligned on a shared KPI glossary—Attrition (vol/invol), Time-to-Hire,
  Stage Conversion, Offer Acceptance, Representation %, and Compensation Band
  Delta—and a North Star of “time-to-decision under 72 hours.” With alignment
  in place, I led delivery: data contracts with HRIS/ATS, a modeled semantic
  layer, row-level security and small-n suppression, and a Tableau interface
  designed for self-serve plus a certified month-end snapshot. The result is an
  automated workflow that saves hours per week for HRBPs, surfaces early risk,
  and satisfies governance—an example of PM craft from discovery → alignment →
  KPI definition → build → launch → adoption.
