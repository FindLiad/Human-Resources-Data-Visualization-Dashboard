## Business Requirements vs. Customer Needs

      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        A global client was struggling to unify HR data scattered across multiple systemsâ€”talent acquisition,
        payroll, performance, and complianceâ€”making workforce planning reactive and error-prone.
        Leadership wanted to use data to inform DEI, hiring, and layoff decisions, but the lack of a single
        source of truth introduced high regulatory and financial risk. I was brought in to design and deliver
        an enterprise HR analytics dashboard. My task was to balance customer expectations for flexibility with
        my companyâ€™s requirement to deliver a secure, scalable tool that could standardize decision-making across stakeholders.

    <div class="story-copy">
      <h3>Action</h3>
      <p>
        I set the product strategy around three pillars: <em>compliance-ready reporting</em>,
        <em>role-based usability</em>, and <em>scalable integrations</em>. Initial alignment came quickly
        across executives and finance, but a senior HR leader pushed back, demanding immediate, highly granular
        demographic filters. This created a fork in the roadmap: accelerate HRâ€™s feature at risk of data exposure,
        or delay and risk adoption resistance. To break the deadlock, I applied a prioritization matrixâ€”
        <strong>regulatory risk</strong>, <strong>business impact</strong>, and <strong>implementation effort</strong>â€”
        then repositioned the HR leaderâ€™s concern as a phased deliverable. I secured alignment by rescoping their
        feature as a compliance-safe release in iteration two.

      <h3>Result</h3>
      <p>
        I executed delivery in two phases: first, a core dashboard unifying demographics, salary, tenure, and
        performance with strict role-based access; second, extended DEI filters released once governance rules were
        hardened. This approach unlocked immediate adoption while addressing long-term needs. HR leaders gained
        compliant DEI visibility, finance received real-time workforce cost trends, and executives modeled headcount
        scenarios with confidence. The tool reduced manual reporting hours by 40%, informed board-level workforce
        planning, and turned the previously resistant HR leader into a key champion who showcased the dashboard
        to peers across the enterprise.

## Objective & Success Criteria
**Problem:** Workforce planning is often reactive and anecdotal.  
**Objective:** Ship a repeatable workflow that surfaces **early warning signs** for attrition, bottlenecks in hiring, DEI representation, and comp band alignment.

**Success Criteria**
1. Unified view of workforce health across departments and levels.  
2. Explain *why* a trend is occurring (transparent inputs).  
3. Refresh quickly when new HR data arrives.  

<div align="right"><a href="#site-top">â†‘ Back to top</a></div>

---

## What I Built & Why
- A **single CSV-based dataset** created with a **Python generator script**.  
- A **clean dataset** (`dataset.csv`) stored in the repo for transparency.  
- A **Tableau workbook** (`HR Project.twbx`) that surfaces actionable HR KPIs.  
- A **GitHub Pages site** (this page) that documents assumptions, steps, and outcomes.

**Why this approach?** Itâ€™s **fast, portable, and auditable**â€”teams can open the script, CSVs, and workbook to understand exactly how metrics are produced.

## End-to-End Walkthrough

### 1) Data In
- **Raw input:** `assets/data/dataset.csv`  
  Columns include `employee_id`, `gender`, `department`, `job_title`, `education_level`, `salary`, `performance_rating`, `overtime`, etc.

### 2) Clean & Transform
- Generated via: `assets/scripts/generate_hr_dataset.py`  
- Includes logic for demographics, hiring/termination dates, job roles, salary, and attrition.

### 3) Guardrails (Data Quality Checks)
- **Row count** â€” ~8,950 employees generated.  
- **Column & type sanity** â€” salary numeric, job titles categorical, dates valid.  
- **Duplicates** â€” unique `employee_id` values.

### 4) Derive Metrics
- **Attrition Rate** = `# exits / avg headcount`.  
- **Time-to-Hire** = request open â†’ accepted offer.  
- **Diversity Mix** = representation across gender/state/education.  
- **Comp Band Fit** = midpoint variance vs. performance rating.

## How to Reproduce
1. **Clone** this repo.  
2. Run `assets/scripts/generate_hr_dataset.py` â†’ creates `assets/data/dataset.csv`.  
3. Open `HR Project.twbx` in **Tableau** and point it at `dataset.csv`.  
4. Explore the dashboard; publish to Tableau Public if desired.  
5. To refresh later: rerun the script â†’ re-open workbook (data updates automatically).

## Limitations & Next Steps
- Synthetic dataset (not real HRIS).  
- Attrition not split into voluntary vs involuntary.  
- Hiring funnel simplified to static assumptions.  
- Next: connect to live HRIS export for scheduled refresh.  
- Add predictive attrition risk modeling.
